# floydbomb
A discord.js selfbot that can spam in multiple channels. Focused on shoving more power into a single account, rather than having each bot be very simple like hydrazine. Floydbomb also avoids bans pretty well due to the fact that it picks a random message to spam every time. If you're in a server where no staff can access their own accounts (quite common) this is the bot for you! Run it 24/7 on some shitty VPS or replit, it's not memory intensive and it'll (probably) keep spamming and get you massive amounts of hate.
## Usage/Setup
Run "npm install discord.js-selfbot-v13" in the same directory as the bot files. Change some settings in settings.json then run "node index.js". The command f!spam 1000 will spam a message every second and f!stop stops it. f!status sets a custom status. f!kill kills the bot. Note that all commands are owner only.
